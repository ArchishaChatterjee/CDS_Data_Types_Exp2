# EXPERIMENT 2: C++ Data Types

## Aim
- To study and implement the structure of a basic C++ program.
- To determine the size (in bytes) of different built-in data types in C++.

## Software
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Data Types in C++
Data types in C++ define the type of data a variable can hold. They help in allocating the appropriate amount of memory and defining the kind of operations that can be performed on that data.

Common built-in data types include:
- `int` — for integers
- `float` — for floating-point numbers
- `double` — for double-precision floating-point numbers
- `char` — for single characters
- `bool` — for boolean values (true or false)

C++ also supports derived and user-defined data types such as arrays, structures, and classes.

## Program: Finding the Size of Various Data Types

### Algorithm
1. Start  
2. Declare variables of types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`  
3. Use the `sizeof()` operator to get the size of each data type  
4. Display the results  
5. End

---

## Functions

- Use `sizeof()` to determine the memory size (in bytes) occupied by each data type.
- Understand how different types of data are stored in memory.
- Recognize how platform and compiler architecture may affect data size.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned about the various built-in data types in C++ and how to check their sizes using the `sizeof()` operator. This helped me understand how memory is allocated for different types of data and the importance of choosing the appropriate data type for efficient programming.
