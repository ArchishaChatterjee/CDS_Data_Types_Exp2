# EXPERIMENT 2: C++ Program Structure and Data Types

## Aim
- To study and implement the basic structure of a C++ program.
- To understand and use different data types available in C++.

## Apparatus
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### C++ Program Structure
A basic C++ program follows a specific structure that includes headers, the `main()` function, and statements within curly braces. Understanding this structure is essential for writing and organizing any program in C++.

### Data Types in C++
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. C++ provides several built-in data types, including:
- `int` for integers
- `float` and `double` for floating-point numbers
- `char` for characters
- `bool` for boolean values
- `string` (with `#include<string>`) for text data

Each data type serves a specific purpose and helps in managing memory efficiently during program execution.

## Functions

- Understand and apply the standard structure of a C++ program.
- Declare and initialize variables of different data types.
- Display values of variables using output statements.
- Learn about memory usage and limitations of various data types.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how a C++ program is structured and how to write code using proper syntax. I explored different data types and understood how they are declared, initialized, and used in programs. This experiment helped reinforce the foundational concepts required for developing more complex C++ programs.
